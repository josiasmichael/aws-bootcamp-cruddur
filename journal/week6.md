All are in Week 6 journal. Week 7 Journal is empty.
Watched all videos related to week 6-7 on the Exampro channel and the bootcamp playlist.

 We test the RDS connection first. Make sure its returns a success. This is the script and I chmod u+x so that it is executable.  
 ```sh
 #!/usr/bin/env python3

import psycopg
import os
import sys

connection_url = os.getenv("CONNECTION_URL")

conn = None
try:
  print('attempting connection')
  conn = psycopg.connect(connection_url)
  print("Connection successful!")
except psycopg.Error as e:
  print("Unable to connect to the database:", e)
finally:
  conn.close()
  ```  
  It returns:

Export the env vars before starting and use the ECR CLI command to log-in.  
```sh
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com"
```

After creating the containers, run them using this command e.g. frontend-react-js image  
```sh
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -it frontend-react-js 
```

I get inside the container shell using this command. That task number is unique to mine. so you need to change yours.
