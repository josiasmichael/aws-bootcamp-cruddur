# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS


i watched and followed the additional videos after the livestream. Rewatched multiple times because of thousands of errors. Successfully overcame them all. Very challenging yet FULFILLING week.

I created a RDS Postgres Instance via terminal. Official documentation on this link:  
[AWS RDS CLI create-database docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html)   


i bash script inside the db shell and perform some actions and showing off the database explorer successful localhost connection on the left panel

```py
backend-flask:
    environment:
      CONNECTION_URL: "${CONNECTION_URL}"
```
I have an executable file to setup the database(provided screenshot not yet the prod)
